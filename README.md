## Administrative Information

- 6 lessons will be allocated to the completion of the task.

## Assessment Criteria

Students will be assessed on the degree to which they demonstrate:

- Develops algorithms with diagrams and / or texts to structure and plan programming solutions

- Designs the user experience of a digital system

- Implements and modifies programs with user interfaces in a general purpose programming language

- Evaluate designed solutions and processes

# Task:

“*People have problems. We write software to solve problems.”*

**Problem:**

In this project you will be working to develop an application for a scientist to categorise observations of different amphibians. Using the Python programming language, you are to develop an application that:

1. Has a clear user interface to allow data input

2. Includes programming logic to categorise amphibians into their correct order of the species (see below).

3. Outpts and allows for the storage of results

**Program requirements:**

Your program must be developed in Python. Source code must be supplied.

**Documentation requirements:**

You must include documentation based on the *Design Process scaffold* on SEQTA.

Program must include pseudocode to demonstrate knowledge of code being submitted.

**Submission:**

Your documentation and program files must be zipped and submitted on SEQTA by 5.00pm 10 August 2020.

<u><b>Classfiying amphibians:</b></u>

There are about 6,200 known species of living amphibians.
They are placed in three different orders:

1. Frog and toads

2. Salamanders and newts

3. Caecilians

Frogs and toads are adapted for jumping. Salamanders and newts may walk or swim. Caecilians live in the water or soil and are the only amphibians without legs.

You may want to do further research.
